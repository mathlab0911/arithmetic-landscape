# Pending ledger entries

Entries written mid-round that have not yet been folded into the `pnp-research` skill (§7).
C6 prints this file on every run so nothing written here is lost between skill saves.

**Last fold: 2026-08-15 — 3 blocks from rounds r156–r158.** The cadence rule adopted by fable-5 now sits
beside C20 inside F70, as instructed; the second Japanese-encoding instance joined F69; the
repository split became F77; and sections 9, 12 and 13 carry the practice changes. Case text in
`ledger_archive.md`.

Nothing pending.

## r160 — the canon replayed, and a rule I had and did not use

**Result.** `check_lean.ps1`: three poisoned modules rejected (exit 1 each), all 16 canon
source files inside the import closure of `Pnp`, ten `Pnp/Experiments` files deliberately
outside it, and **every constant of the 17-module canon replayed through the kernel in
179.8 s — PASS**. Nothing in the canon changed this session; this is the periodic confirmation
that it is still green after two days of heavy work on the papers around it.

**And the small thing worth one line.** The first attempt launched the replay with
`powershell -Command`, whose wrapper ate the `$log` variable and produced
`CommandNotFoundException` on a path. §9 of this skill has said *pass PowerShell work as a
script file, not `-Command`* since r116, and one round earlier this same session it gained the
sibling *pass long text as a file, not as an argument*.

## r161 — a default message that was true once

The workshop backup script hardcoded its commit message. The first commit said *"the working
documents, in a repository for the first time"*, which was true. The second run reused it over
three changed files, and asserted the same thing, which was not.

> **A hardcoded message is a claim, and a claim written once into a tool keeps being made after

Small, and the reason it is in the ledger at all: this project's whole discipline is that a
sentence in a permanent record has to be true, and a commit message is a permanent record. The
same shape as F35 (summaries drift) with the drift built into the tool rather than into a
habit.
