## Append to F51 (a fail rule must state its measurement floor) — new instance, r110

```
claimed   : the coset identity Phi_q(s) = (1-1/v)log2 + (1/v)F(vs) holds, floor 1e-12
actual    : the identity is exact, but the float comparison of the two sides disagreed by
            3.9e-11 and the fail rule fired on arithmetic
check     : ask what the CONDITION NUMBER of the comparison is before choosing the floor.
            F = -log|cos| amplifies the 1e-16 rounding of its argument by 1/dist-to-pole, so
            no fixed floor in the logarithmic form is meaningful.  Compare in the ALGEBRAIC
            form instead (products, not logs), where nothing is amplified: the same identity
            then agrees to 4.4e-16, and to 2.2e-61 at 60 digits.
rule      : before setting the floor of a fail rule, identify the operation in the comparison
            that amplifies rounding, and restate the comparison in a form that does not
            contain it.  An identity has many equivalent forms and they are not equally
            conditioned; test the one that is.

## Append to F03 (evaluate at the worst case in range) — new instance, r112

```
claimed   : "min_L [log2 + Cl_2(2 pi L)/(2 pi L)] = log2 - 3 Cl_2(pi/3)/(5 pi) = 0.4993,
             attained at L = 5/6, because Cl_2 is minimal at 5 pi/3"
actual    : the minimum is 0.494530 at L = 0.7908.  L sits in the DENOMINATOR as well as
            inside Cl_2, so minimising the numerator locates the wrong point.
check     : one line -- scan the quantity itself over the parameter, not the factor you can
            recognise.  Written into the script as a prediction, it was falsified in the
            first run and cost nothing.
rule      : the extremiser of one factor of a product or ratio is not the extremiser of the
            product or ratio.  When a bound has the shape f(x)/x, or f(x) g(x), locate the
            extremum of the whole expression -- a named constant sitting inside it is a
            temptation to stop early, not a shortcut.  (Corollary of F03's "evaluate at the
            worst case in range": first find out where the worst case IS.)
```

## F55 — second instance, r114: the control must be on the SEARCH, not on the function

```
claimed   : "positive control passed" on an end-to-end scan for max F_A(theta)^(1/b)
actual    : the scan reported a MAXIMUM of 0.5690 while having itself evaluated 0.7071 at
            theta = 1/4 — a maximum below a value it had computed.  The net had spacing
            1.7e-5 and the peak is O(1/N) = 7.8e-6 wide.
check     : the control asserted `|F_A(1/4) - 1/sqrt2| < 1e-12`, which is a property of the
            FUNCTION and is true whatever the net does.  The control that works asserts
            `|argmax - 1/4| < 3/N`, which is a property of the SEARCH.
rule      : F55 written one round earlier said "a search needs a control point whose answer is
            known".  It is not enough for the control point to be evaluated: the control must
            be the assertion that THE SEARCH RETURNS IT.  Write the control as a statement
            about the search's output, never about the integrand.  (F37's recursion, again:
            the round that writes a lesson is the round most likely to violate it.)
```

## F55 — a search over a net needs a positive control

```
claimed   : "the minimum of G over the minor arcs is 0.652, and it is not at theta = 1/4"
actual    : the minimum is 0.3466 AT theta = 1/4, exactly (1/2)log 2.  The scan used 1001
            evenly spaced points and the dip at 1/4 has width O(1/N) = 1.2e-4, so the net
            stepped straight over it and reported the value of a nearby ordinary point.
check     : put a point whose answer is already known inside the search space and require the
            search to FIND it.  Here theta = 1/4 was known to give (1/2)log 2 from
            Theorem thm:modfour; a scan that does not recover it has the wrong resolution and
            its output is noise, whatever it prints.
rule      : any search over a discretised domain -- a theta net, a grid of parameters, a
            random sample -- must contain a control point whose answer is known independently,
            and the search must be reported as invalid unless it recovers it.  Resolution is
            a parameter you chose (F26); the control is how you find out you chose it wrong.
            Sharper than F26 because the failure here was silent and self-consistent: the
            coarse scan returned the same wrong answer at all three exclusion radii.
```
